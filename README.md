# BFB
chr22_sim.fa is generated data  
sim.ipynb is script  
chr22 contain a lot of 'N' in the begining and end. Did not include these sequences in the fusion process.  
## Assumption:  
1. BFB occurs at end of chr22
2. Reccurent BFB process occurs at the longer daughter chromosome (the chromosome will become longer)
