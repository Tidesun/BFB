# BFB
chr22_sim.fa is generated data  
sim.ipynb is script  
chr22 contain a lot of 'N' in the begining and end. Did not include these sequences in the fusion process.  
## Assumption:  
1. BFB occurs at end of chr22
2. Reccurent BFB process occurs at the longer daughter chromosome (the chromosome will become longer)
3. Fusion area is chosen from last 1000 bp and breakage point is randomly chosen
